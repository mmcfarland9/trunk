# Getting Started with Trunk: A Realistic Progression Plan

## Understanding the Metaphor

Trunk uses a garden/tree metaphor for personal growth:

| Concept | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Trunk** | Your whole life | The center of who you are |
| **Branches** (8) | Life domains | Health, Career, Relationships, Learning, Creativity, Finance, Home, Spirit |
| **Twigs** (64) | Focus areas | "Morning routine", "Side project", "Date nights" |
| **Sprouts** | Goals/habits | "Meditate 10min daily", "Finish chapter 3", "Call mom weekly" |
| **Leaves** | Goal sagas | A sequence of related sprouts over time |

## Resources

| Resource | Represents | Mechanic |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Soil** | Focus capacity | Spent to plant sprouts, slowly regenerates |
| **Water** | Daily attention | Limited per day, used for journaling check-ins |
| **Sun** | Reflection | Limited per day, used for reviewing completed goals |

## Sprout Settings

**Seasons** (how long):
- 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year

**Environments** (difficulty):
- **Fertile**: Easier, lower cost, no capacity reward
- **Firm**: Medium difficulty, +1 capacity reward on completion
- **Barren**: Hard mode, flat cost of 3, +2 capacity reward

## Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-7)

### Day 1: Map Your Life

**Goal:** Label your 8 branches with life domains that matter to you.

Suggested domains (customize to fit your life):
1. **Health** — Physical wellbeing, exercise, sleep, nutrition
2. **Career** — Work, professional growth, skills
3. **Relationships** — Family, friends, partner, community
4. **Learning** — Education, reading, curiosity, mastery
5. **Creativity** — Art, writing, music, side projects
6. **Finance** — Money, savings, investments, security
7. **Home** — Living space, organization, environment
8. **Spirit** — Purpose, values, mindfulness, meaning

**Action:** Click each branch and give it a name.

### Day 2-3: Pick One Branch to Focus

**Goal:** Choose your most important or most neglected domain.

Don't try to fix everything at once. Pick ONE branch that:
- Has been bothering you lately, OR
- Would have the biggest positive ripple effect

**Action:** Click into that branch and look at the 8 twigs.

### Day 4-5: Plant Your First Sprout

**Goal:** Create one small, achievable goal.

**Recommended first sprout settings:**
- **Season:** 1 week (short feedback loop)
- **Environment:** Fertile (easy mode while learning)
- **Title:** Something specific and measurable

**Good first sprouts:**
- "Drink 8 glasses of water daily"
- "Read for 15 minutes before bed"
- "Take a 10-minute walk after lunch"
- "Write 3 things I'm grateful for"

**Bad first sprouts:**
- "Get healthy" (too vague)
- "Finish my novel" (too big for 1 week)
- "Be a better person" (not measurable)

### Day 6-7: Start Watering

**Goal:** Build the habit of daily check-ins.

Each day, click on your growing sprout and hit "Water". The app will give you a journaling prompt. Write 1-3 sentences.

**What watering does:**
- Keeps you connected to your goal
- Slowly regenerates soil capacity
- Creates a record of your journey

---

## Week 2: First Harvest (Days 8-14)

### Day 8: Harvest Your First Sprout

If you planted a 1-week sprout, it should be ready to harvest.

**Harvest process:**
1. Click the sprout showing "READY"
2. Rate your result (1-5 scale)
3. Write a brief reflection

**Be honest with your rating:**
- 5 = Nailed it, exceeded expectations
- 4 = Solid effort, achieved the goal
- 3 = Partial success, learned something
- 2 = Struggled, but showed up
- 1 = Didn't really happen

### Day 9-10: Shine on Your Harvest

**Goal:** Reflect on what you learned.

Click "Shine" on your completed sprout. The app gives you reflection prompts about the journey, what you learned, and what's next.

**Why this matters:**
- Closes the loop mentally
- Extracts lessons for future goals
- Builds your sense of progress

### Day 11-14: Plant 2-3 More Sprouts

Now that you've completed one cycle, expand slightly:

**Option A: Same branch, new twig**
Plant another sprout in the same life domain but a different focus area.

**Option B: Different branch**
Try a second life domain that needs attention.

**Recommended:**
- Keep at least one sprout at 1-week duration
- Try one 2-week sprout to practice longer commitment
- Stay in Fertile environment until you're comfortable

---

## Week 3-4: Building Rhythm (Days 15-28)

### Establish Daily Practice

**Morning (2 min):**
- Glance at your growing sprouts
- Note which ones you'll work on today

**Evening (5 min):**
- Water your sprouts (write brief check-ins)
- Harvest anything that's ready

### Gradually Increase Complexity

**Week 3:**
- Maintain 2-3 active sprouts
- Try your first "Firm" environment sprout (medium difficulty)
- Label a few twigs with specific focus areas

**Week 4:**
- Expand to 3-4 active sprouts maximum
- Try a 1-month season sprout
- Start using Leaves to group related goals

---

## Month 2: Finding Your Flow (Days 29-60)

### Capacity Management

By now you understand your sustainable load:
- How many sprouts can you actively water?
- What's your natural rhythm?

**Warning signs of overload:**
- Dreading the app
- Skipping water sessions
- Starting sprouts but not finishing

**If overloaded:** Let some sprouts fail. It's better to complete 2 sprouts well than struggle with 5.

### Branch Balance

Start thinking about balance across life domains:
- Are you ignoring any branches?
- Is one domain eating all your energy?
- What's the minimum viable attention for neglected areas?

### Difficulty Progression

Once you're comfortable:
1. Try "Firm" environment for moderate challenges
2. Reserve "Barren" for goals you really want to push yourself on
3. Longer seasons (3-6 months) for bigger projects

---

## Long-Term: The Garden Grows

### Quarterly Review (Every 3 Months)

1. Look at your cultivated sprouts (completed goals)
2. Shine on any you haven't reflected on
3. Notice patterns: What environments/seasons work for you?
4. Adjust your branch focus for the next quarter

### Leaves: Building Sagas

As you complete related sprouts, they form Leaves — narratives of progress in a focus area:
- "Learning Spanish" might have 6 sprouts over a year
- "Getting fit" builds through many small wins
- "Building a side project" grows chapter by chapter

### The Meta-Game

Eventually, you're not just tracking habits — you're:
- Understanding your capacity limits
- Seeing patterns in what you commit to vs. complete
- Building a history of growth
- Designing your life intentionally

## Quick Reference

### Starting Resources (Default)
- Soil: 10/10 capacity
- Water: 3/day
- Sun: 3/day

### Recommended First Month
| Week | Active Sprouts | Seasons | Environment |
|------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | 1 | 1w | Fertile |
| 2 | 2 | 1w, 2w | Fertile |
| 3 | 2-3 | 1w, 2w | Fertile, 1 Firm |
| 4 | 3-4 | 1w, 2w, 1m | Mixed |

### Don't
- Plant 10 sprouts on day 1
- Start with 6-month Barren goals
- Beat yourself up for failed sprouts
- Skip the journaling (watering)

### Do
- Start tiny and prove the system works
- Water daily, even just one sentence
- Celebrate completed sprouts
- Let yourself fail and learn from it
