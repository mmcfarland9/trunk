## All Ideas by Category

### A. Missing Features

Features users would expect based on what's already built.

| # | Feature | Scope | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|-------|
| A1 | Edit sprout (title, bloom, season) | Medium | New `sprout_edited` event. Form exists, needs edit mode |
| A2 | Rename leaf (saga) | Small | New `leaf_renamed` event. Leaf name is prominent in sidebar |
| A3 | Delete leaf / reassign sprouts to different leaf | Medium | New `sprout_moved_to_leaf` event |
| A4 | Search/filter sprouts on web | Medium | iOS has `SproutFilterBar.swift`. Web has nothing |
| A5 | Sprout detail view on web | Medium | iOS has `SproutDetailView.swift`. Web shows cards only |
| A6 | Early harvest (before end date) | Small | Remove/relax `isReady()` check. Maybe reduced reward |
| A7 | Extend/pause sprout timer | Medium | New event type. End date recalculation |
| A8 | Per-sprout water history on web | Small | Data exists in `DerivedSprout.waterEntries`. Needs click-to-expand |
| A9 | Streak tracking / consistency metrics | Medium | All timestamps exist. Needs derivation + display |
| A10 | Notifications backend | Large | Account dialog has full prefs UI (channel, frequency, time). No backend sends anything |
| A11 | Soil chart on web | Small | `soil-charting.ts` is complete. Zero chart UI |
| A12 | Twig/branch customization (rename) | Medium | Inputs exist but are readonly. Need label change events |
| A13 | Today dashboard on web | Medium-Large | iOS has `TodayView.swift`. Web lands on tree overview |
| A14 | Undo last action | Medium | Event sourcing supports `event_reverted` meta-event naturally |
| A15 | Dark mode | Small-Medium | CSS variables on web, semantic colors on iOS |
| A16 | Export on web | Small | iOS has `DataExportService`. Web has key refs but no UI |
| A17 | Offline support / PWA | Medium | Pending-uploads queue exists. LocalStorage is primary store |

### B. Unexpected Features

Capabilities beyond current scope that would make Trunk significantly more valuable.

| # | Feature | Scope | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|-------|
| B1 | Compost heap — learning from uprooted goals | Small | Reflection on uproot, reduced penalty over time |
| B2 | Root system — connections between twigs | Medium | Cross-twig micro soil benefits. SVG overlay |
| B3 | Pruning mode — quarterly branch prioritization | Medium | Nourish/maintain/rest per branch. Commitment device |
| B4 | Companion planting — synergistic goal bonuses | Small | Short+long or fertile+barren pairs give micro bonuses |
| B5 | Weather system — variable daily conditions | Medium | Deterministic daily weather modulates water/sun capacity |
| B6 | Seed bank — goal templates from past success | Medium | Save high-result sprouts as reusable templates |
| B7 | Time capsule letters — messages to future self | Small | Sealed letter at plant, revealed at harvest |
| B8 | Growth rings — annual review visualization | Large | Concentric ring diagram, year-over-year comparison |
| B9 | Seasons of life — calendar-aware personality | Medium | Prompts, colors, modifiers shift with real seasons |
| B10 | Moonlight journal — evening free-form reflection | Small | Post-7pm journaling, no resource cost, tied to branch |
| B11 | Harvest festival — milestone celebrations | Small-Medium | Confetti, special messages at key milestones |
| B12 | Dormancy detection — smart re-engagement | Small | Normalize breaks, gentle return ritual after 14+ days |
| B13 | Soil composition — per-branch capacity analytics | Medium | Decompose capacity by branch. Radar chart |
| B14 | Pollination alerts — cross-twig suggestions | Medium-Large | Content analysis across twigs for goal suggestions |
| B15 | Grafting — move sprouts between twigs | Small | New event, cheaper than uproot+replant, preserves history |

### C. UX Leverage Points

Small interaction upgrades with outsized daily experience impact.

| # | Feature | Scope | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|-------|
| C1 | Post-action celebration feedback | Small | CSS animations on meters after water/harvest/shine |
| C2 | W/S/H keyboard shortcuts for daily actions | Small | ~15 lines in existing keydown handler |
| C3 | Auto-close water dialog when all watered | Small | Detect all `is-watered`, close after 1.5s delay |
| C4 | Sidebar water button targets specific sprout | Small | `openWaterDialog(sprout)` path exists, sidebar doesn't use it |
| C5 | Streak indicator on resource meters | Medium | Tiny counter near water meter showing consecutive days |
| C6 | Twig view empty state with plant CTA | Small | Welcoming message when twig has 0 sprouts |
| C7 | Scroll trunk in overview opens water dialog | Small | Extend existing scroll-to-zoom pattern |
| C8 | Dynamic keyboard hints in sidebar | Small | Context-aware hints: show W when water available |
| C9 | Harvest dialog bloom hints react to slider | Medium | Bloom text fades in/out as slider moves |
| C10 | Re-read shine reflection when already shone | Small | Show this week's reflection in "already shone" state |
| C11 | Twig transition name overlay | Small | Brief twig name on canvas during branch→twig zoom |
| C12 | Mobile resource meters as action buttons | Small | CSS-only touch affordance under `@media (pointer: coarse)` |
